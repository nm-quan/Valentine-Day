	<p id="text-portrait">Ha Linh is not only beautiful in a way that makes people turn their heads She is beautiful in
		a way that leaves them speechless Her long black hair falls softly over her shoulders smooth and shining When
		the wind touches it it lifts gently like the wings of a phoenix stirring in the sunlight Sometimes I stand a
		little behind her just to watch her hair move my heart filled with a warmth I cannot explain When the evening
		sun casts a golden light over her she seems to glow Her eyes are what captivate me most They are clear yet deep
		sparkling as if they hold the entire sky within them Her gaze is both gentle and strong like a quiet flame that
		can warm even the coldest day Whenever she looks at me and gives a small smile I feel illuminated as if even
		someone as slow and ordinary as I am can stand in the light of a phoenix Her smile is bright without being
		overwhelming She smiles with her eyes with softly blushing cheeks and lips that curve gracefully When she smiles
		the world around me seems to slow down In that moment nothing else matters Her smile is like a steady fire not
		wild or fierce but powerful enough to make my heart tremble Her fair rosy skin complements the dresses she wears
		so naturally She does not need heavy makeup Her beauty is pure and effortless Every step she takes is light yet
		confident like a proud phoenix spreading its wings across the sky There is something about her that is both
		delicate and strong soft yet full of life But seeing her with my eyes is not enough I see her with my feelings
		as well The way she tilts her head when she listens the simple gesture of brushing a strand of hair away the way
		she stands in the sunlight looking toward the distance All these small details create a vivid and radiant image
		in my mind I hold onto those moments quietly as if they are precious treasures Sometimes I wonder how someone
		like me can walk beside a girl as beautiful as a phoenix I am slow quiet and often unnoticed She is bright
		captivating and full of presence Yet when she walks next to me and her hair lightly brushes my shoulder I feel
		incredibly fortunate I do not need to do anything special Just looking at her is enough to fill my heart To me
		Ha Linh is not beautiful only because of her features or her figure She is beautiful because of her presence
		because of the natural light that seems to shine from within her It is the beauty of a phoenix radiant without
		trying admired without seeking admiration And I Rua simply stand there in quiet admiration gazing at the girl

		phoenix stirring in the sunlight Sometimes I stand a little behind her just to watch her hair move my heart
		filled with a warmth I cannot explain When the evening sun casts a golden light over her she seems to glow Her
		eyes are what captivate me most They are clear yet deep sparkling as if they hold the entire sky within them Her
		gaze is both gentle and strong like a quiet flame that can warm even the coldest day Whenever she looks at me
		and gives a small smile I feel illuminated as if even someone as slow and ordinary as I am can stand in the
		light of a phoenix Her smile is bright without being overwhelming She smiles with her eyes with softly blushing
		cheeks and lips that curve gracefully When she smiles the world around me seems to slow down In that moment
		nothing else matters Her smile is like a steady fire not wild or fierce but powerful enough to make my heart
		tremble Her fair rosy skin complements the dresses she wears so naturally She does not need heavy makeup Her
		beauty is pure and effortless Every step she takes is light yet confident like a proud phoenix spreading its
		wings across the sky There is something about her that is both delicate and strong soft yet full of life But
		seeing her with my eyes is not enough I see her with my feelings as well The way she tilts her head when she
		listens the simple gesture of brushing a strand of hair away the way she stands in the sunlight looking toward
		the distance All these small details create a vivid and radiant image in my mind I hold onto those moments
		quietly as if they are precious treasures Sometimes I wonder how someone like me can walk beside a girl as
		beautiful as a phoenix I am slow quiet and often unnoticed She is bright captivating and full of presence Yet
		when she walks next to me and her hair lightly brushes my shoulder I feel incredibly fortunate I do not need to
		do anything special Just looking at her is enough to fill my heart To me Ha Linh is not beautiful only because
		of her features or her figure She is beautiful because of her presence because of the natural light that seems
		to shine from within her It is the beauty of a phoenix radiant without trying admired without seeking admiration
		And I Rua simply stand there in quiet admiration gazing at the girl who lights up my life A girl named Ha Linh
		my love beautiful like a phoenix in the vastness of the skyHa Linh is not only beautiful in a way that makes
		people turn their heads She is beautiful in a way that leaves them speechless Her long black hair falls softly
		over her shoulders smooth and shining When the wind touches it it lifts gently like the wings of a phoenix
		stirring in the sunlight Sometimes I stand a little behind her just to watch her hair move my heart filled with
		a warmth I cannot explain When the evening sun casts a golden light over her she seems to glow Her eyes are what
		captivate me most They are clear yet deep sparkling as if they hold the entire sky within them Her gaze is both
